/**
 * Prompt-fragment producer for the `agent-identity` plugin.
 *
 * Emits a SINGLE system-prompt line naming the agent, e.g.
 *
 *   You are working as Laura.
 *
 * or nothing at all when naming is explicitly disabled (an off sentinel;
 * naming is otherwise on by default and resolves to `auto`). The name is
 * resolved once at boot in the host (`resolveAgentName`) and published as
 * `MINIMAL_AGENT_AGENT_NAME`; the loader spreads `process.env` into this
 * fragment's `ctx.env`, so we just read the already-resolved value here. No
 * hashing or config parsing happens in the plugin: the host owns that so the
 * value is identical everywhere (system prompt, future intercom/fleet labels).
 *
 * CACHE NOTE: this fragment lands in the composed plugin block, which is the
 * agent's per-session `sessionContext` system block, AFTER the cross-session
 * `scope:"global"` cache breakpoint on the instructions block. So the name
 * rides in already-variable, already-uncached-across-sessions content and
 * costs zero shared-prefix cache. See this plugin's README for the full
 * rationale. The producer is pure + synchronous + deterministic, so the
 * composed system prompt stays byte-stable for the whole session (the loader
 * memoizes the block on first assembly).
 *
