/**
 * Capability tables for HuggingFace Inference Providers.
 *
 * HuggingFace is a gateway that proxies to 13+ backend providers, so the real
 * capability set is per-model AND per-backend. Two layers here:
 *
 * 1. {@link CAPS_HUGGINGFACE_CHAT} — a PERMISSIVE default for the Chat
 *    Completions surface. HuggingFace's router gracefully IGNORES unsupported
 *    parameters (verified live: `reasoning_effort` on a non-reasoning model
 *    returns 200 and is dropped), so the correct posture for a gateway is to
 *    declare the superset and let the router handle per-model reality, rather
 *    than hard-rejecting valid requests. In particular reasoning is enabled:
 *    HF Chat accepts `reasoning_effort` (low/medium/high/xhigh) and streams
 *    `reasoning_content` back, which the reused llm-openai translator already
 *    maps to thinking blocks. The old table left `effort.levels: []` +
 *    `thinking.adaptive: false`, which hard-rejected `--effort` and
 *    `--thinking` on every reasoning model (DeepSeek-V4, gpt-oss, GLM, Qwen3
 *    thinking, ...).
 *
 * 2. {@link deriveHuggingFaceCapabilities} — builds EXACT caps for one model
 *    from its live `/v1/models` entry (context window, tools, structured
 *    outputs, image modality), OR-ing the boolean capabilities across the
 *    model's backend providers (a capability true on ANY backend is reachable
 *    by pinning `model:provider`). Reasoning stays permissive because the HF
 *    API exposes no reasoning/effort field at all.
 *
 * The Responses surface is not yet wired (Chat only).
 *
