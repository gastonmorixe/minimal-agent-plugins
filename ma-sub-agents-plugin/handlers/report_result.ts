 * never touches a path or hand-rolls JSON, so the brittle part of the protocol
 * is owned by code, not by the model remembering an exact format.
 *
 * Env-gated: the worker carries `MINIMAL_AGENT_SUBAGENT_RESULT_PATH` (stamped by
 * the spawn plan). When that is absent — a LEAD called the tool — there is no
 * sentinel to write, so we return an explanation instead of doing anything.
 *
 * The write is atomic (temp file + rename) so the supervisor's probe, which may
 * read the path on any tick, never sees a half-written sentinel.
