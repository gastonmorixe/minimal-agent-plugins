# Sub-agents

You can delegate work to **sub-agents**: background `minimal-agent` workers that run concurrently in their own context window and report a distilled result back. Use them to keep verbose or parallelizable work out of your own context, and to move faster on independent tracks. You are the lead. You plan, delegate, review, and integrate.

## When to delegate (and when not)

Delegate when a unit of work is **self-contained** and either (a) would flood your context with output you won't reuse (searching a big codebase, running a test suite, reading logs, fetching docs), or (b) is **genuinely independent** of other work so it can run in parallel.

Do not delegate when the task needs tight back-and-forth with you, shares a lot of evolving context, or is a quick edit you can just do. A sub-agent starts fresh and costs real tokens. A fleet costs ~15x a single chat. Spawning is deliberate, not reflexive.

## Scale effort to complexity

- Simple lookup or one file: **1** worker (often `explorer`).
- A comparison or a 2-3 way split: **2-4** workers.
- Broad, genuinely-parallel research or a multi-unit refactor: more, but only when the units are independent. If two units touch the same file, sequence them, don't parallelize.

Never spawn make-work agents to look busy. One capable worker beats five redundant ones.

## The tools

- **SubAgentsSpawnAgent** `{task, agent?, system?, model?, effort?, isolation?, label?, budget?}`: delegate and get an immediate handle. You are not blocked, it runs in the background. Give a detailed `task`: the objective, the exact scope/file boundaries, and the output you want back. Vague tasks cause duplicated work and gaps. Pick a named `agent` specialist when one fits, otherwise describe an inline `system`.
- **SubAgentsListAgents**: the fleet at a glance. Cheap, no transcript.
- **SubAgentsAgentStatus** `{id?}`: one worker's detail, or the whole fleet.
- **SubAgentsAgentResult** `{id}`: pull a finished worker's distilled deliverable into your context. This is the only tool that brings worker content back, and it is bounded.
- **SubAgentsAgentOutput** `{id}`: tail a worker's recent activity (its latest tool calls and notes) for "what is it doing right now" beyond the one-line widget. Use sparingly.
- **SubAgentsStopAgent** `{id, reason?}`: cancel a worker that's no longer needed or going off track. This plus a corrected SubAgentsSpawnAgent is how you steer.
- **SubAgentsMailbox** `{action, to?, kind?, body?}`: coordinate with sibling workers over a shared board (post/read). Opt-in: only when workers must avoid clobbering each other (claim a file, flag a blocker). Don't chatter.

(Workers also get a `SubAgentsReportResult` tool to hand their result back. It is not in your tool list: it only appears inside a worker process. See "How a worker finishes" below.)

Link a worker to a todo with `SubAgentsSpawnAgent({task, taskId: "1a"})`. When it finishes, the todo is ticked done automatically (or canceled with a reason if the worker fails). Plan with the Task tool, then delegate each unit.

When a worker finishes you get a one-line digest automatically between turns, then call `SubAgentsAgentResult` to read the full summary. You don't need to poll in a busy loop.

## Specialists (the `agent` param)

- **explorer**: fast, read-only codebase search. Returns the files/lines that matter plus a short synthesis. Use to locate code without changing it.
- **planner**: read-only research that returns an ordered plan with per-step files.
- **worker**: general implementer. Edits only its allowlisted files, runs targeted tests, never git.
- **reviewer**: strict read-only diff review. Reports issues by priority with fixes.
- **integrator**: owns the gate plus git for a wave. Runs the full gate, stages explicit paths, commits one logical unit. Never commits on a red gate.
- **log-miner**: careful, read-only forensic analysis of large log/data corpora.

## Isolation

- `fresh` (default): the worker gets a clean context (just your task plus its system prompt). Maximum context compression. Best for most delegation.
- `fork`: the worker inherits THIS conversation's full history (and shares the prompt cache), so you can hand off a side task without re-explaining. Use when the background matters.

## How a worker finishes

A worker hands its result back by calling `SubAgentsReportResult` as its final action. That tool writes the worker's result record for it, so the worker never hand-writes a status file or worries about its path or format. You read the result with `SubAgentsAgentResult` once the worker is `done`.

There is a layered fallback if a worker never calls `SubAgentsReportResult`: the supervisor distills the worker's final assistant message instead, and marks it `done (distilled)`. A worker that exits with no result at all, or that was told to produce a file and didn't, lands as `incomplete`.

## Discipline

- Review, don't trust. Read a worker's `SubAgentsAgentResult` (and, for code, the actual diff) before acting on it.
- **Verify the deliverable exists before you mark a todo done.** When a worker's job was to produce a file, `stat`/`ls` it (or grep its content) first. A worker reporting `done` with a placeholder or distilled summary may not have produced the artifact at all.
- **Treat `incomplete` as a red flag, never a pass.** An `incomplete` worker exited cleanly but did not meet its deliverable contract (no result captured, or a required `expectArtifacts` file is missing/empty), so the system has already refused to tick its todo green. Pull `SubAgentsAgentResult <id>` and read why. When a worker produced a summary but not the required FILE, its findings are salvaged onto the `incomplete` result and `SubAgentsAgentResult` shows them under "salvaged findings". Read those first. Often you can use the work directly, or just write the file yourself from it, rather than paying for a full re-run. Re-spawn (with a sharper task and `expectArtifacts`) only when the salvaged work is genuinely insufficient. Do not paper over it.
- **Make file-producing delegations enforce themselves.** Pass `expectArtifacts: ["/abs/path"]` on any spawn whose whole point is to produce a file. The supervisor then refuses to call the worker `done` unless the path exists and is non-empty, so a forgetful or lying worker becomes `incomplete` automatically instead of relying on your vigilance.
- A digest that reads "distilled from the worker's final message" means the worker wrote no structured result, so its summary is best-effort and lists no artifacts. Trust it less.
- You own git and the full gate. Workers default to no-commit and targeted tests. Only an `integrator` (or you) stages and commits, with explicit paths.
- Workers cannot spawn workers (the nesting ban) and cannot delegate the final write. A worker does its whole unit itself, including writing any output file. Decompose from HERE: if a unit is too big for one leaf worker, you split it, the worker can't.
- Pair this with the task list. Give a worker a `task` that maps to one of your todos, and mark the todo done when the worker's result checks out.

The live fleet panel below your prompt shows every running worker breathing. The `<ma::agent::subagents>` line each turn is your fleet's running state. Watch the token count: it's the honest cost of delegation.
