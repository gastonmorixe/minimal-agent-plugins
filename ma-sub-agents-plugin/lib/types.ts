/**
 * Core domain types for the sub-agents plugin.
 *
 * Design posture (see `private/subagent-research-and-plan/research/05-pattern-decisions.md`):
 *
 * - **Discriminated Union State** for {@link SubagentStatus}: a worker's
 *   lifecycle is a tagged union so illegal states are unrepresentable (a
 *   `done` worker carries a result; a `failed` one an error; a `running` one a
 *   live pid). No status-string-plus-nullable-fields soup.
 * - **Branded types** for {@link SubagentId} and {@link SessionId} so a handle
 *   id ("A2") and a session uuid can never be swapped at a call site.
 * - **Result** for fallible operations, so failures are typed values, not
 *   thrown exceptions (no dependency; a 6-line local helper).
 *
 * This module is PURE types + tiny constructors. No I/O, no process, no clock.
 *
 * @module sub-agents/lib/types

 * a missing deliverable is a signal the lead has to act on, not a silent success.
 * It carries the counts so the widget can show effort spent, a `reason` the lead
 * can read, and — crucially — any `salvage` synthesis the worker DID produce
 * (its sentinel text or distilled final message) so a contract miss never throws
 * away the work. The lead still re-spawns/verifies, but reads the findings first.
