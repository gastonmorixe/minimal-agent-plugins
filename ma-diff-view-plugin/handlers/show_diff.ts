/**
 * Tool-call handler for the `ShowDiff` tool.
 *
 * Note: the handler `id` and file path stay as `show_diff` (loader-internal,
 * never user-visible). The model-facing tool name was renamed to `ShowDiff`
 * to match the convention used by built-ins (`Bash`, `Read`, `WebSearch`,
 * etc.). The legacy `show_diff` name is preserved as an alias on the
 * manifest so resumed sessions and muscle-memory calls keep working
 * silently — see manifest.json's `tool.aliases` field and the dispatcher
 * in src/plugins/loader.ts.
 *
 * Reads `patch` and optional `title` from the tool input and returns the
 * rendered diff as a tool_result. Non-interactive: the agent loop receives
 * the ansi-colored string as the tool output and continues.
