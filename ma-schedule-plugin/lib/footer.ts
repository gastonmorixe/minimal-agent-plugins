/**
 * Colored, width-aware live-area footer row for scheduled tasks.
 *
 * TUI-only (never seen by the model), so unlike ./format.ts it emits real ANSI
 * via the shared {@link PALETTE} — matching the quota footer so the colors line
 * up. The glyph is the focal point and carries state through color:
 *   - `⧗` gold  → tasks pending, next fire is more than a minute out
 *   - `⧗` lime  → the soonest task is imminent (due now / within a minute)
 *
 * The row PROGRESSIVELY discloses detail to fit the terminal width (its own
 * dedicated footer line, so the budget is the full `cols`):
 *
 *   wide    ⧗ v3muss8a next in 26s  ·  aef21c3d 9f2b1a7e
 *   medium  ⧗ v3muss8a next in 26s  ·  +2
 *   narrow  ⧗ next in 26s · 3 tasks
 *   tiny    ⧗ 3 tasks
 *   floor   ⧗
 *
 * The soonest task leads (bold glyph + its short id in the glyph color + its
 * countdown); the remaining task ids trail dim, as many as fit, with a `+K`
 * overflow marker. Showing the ids lets the user see WHICH loops are armed,
 * not just how many.
 *
