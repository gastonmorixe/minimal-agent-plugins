/**
 * Prompt-fragment handler for the `tasks` plugin's PLAN/PHASES guidance.
 *
 * Runs once at session start (via the loader's `promptFragments`
 * mechanism). Returns one short paragraph telling the model to PLAN and work
 * in PHASES with TASKs and SUB-TASKs. The text gets folded into the same
 * `<ma::sys::tool name="Task">` section the plugin's `PROMPT.md` produces.
 *
 * ## Why this lives here, not in core `instructions.md`
 *
 * The guidance only makes sense when the `Task` tool actually exists. The
 * core instructions block is provider-neutral and ships to EVERY model,
 * including ones with no user-defined-tool support, where "use the Task tool"
 * is noise. By contributing the line as a tasks-plugin fragment we get two
 * layers of gating for free:
 *
 *   1. The fragment self-gates here on `tools.userDefined` (see below): a
 *      model that can't call user tools never sees the paragraph.
 *   2. The loader already drops a plugin's ENTIRE prompt section when its
 *      tool surface is hidden for the turn (see `buildBlock` in
 *      `src/plugins/loader.ts`), so even the PROMPT.md body disappears when
 *      the `Task` tool isn't advertised.
 *
 * ## No hardcoded prompt text
 *
 * The paragraph is read from `prompts/planning.md` (a sibling file), never
 * embedded as a TS string literal. One uniform "prose lives in markdown"
 * convention, same as the rest of the agent's prompts.
