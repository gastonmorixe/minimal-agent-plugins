/**
 * Drift guard for the tasks PROMPT.md.
 *
 * The model-facing prompt is the only thing keeping the agent from
 * reaching for `canceled` to mean "phase complete". The renderer
 * paints canceled rows in red with strikethrough, which is the
 * opposite of what "the phase is done" should look like.
 *
 * A real session in May 2026 hit exactly this: every "PHASE N"
 * top-level task got marked `canceled` with reason "phase header,
 * all subtasks done" once its phase finished. The user saw 7 red
 * strikethrough rows interleaved with the lime ✔ children and asked
 * why completed tasks were red. They weren't completed in the data,
 * they were canceled. Agent's fault, not the renderer's.
 *
 * The PROMPT.md addition below the `## Status state machine` section
 * (heading: `canceled is "abandoned", not "done"`) names the
 * anti-pattern explicitly. This test pins that guidance is present so
 * a future PROMPT.md rewrite either keeps it, or fails this guard and
 * forces the maintainer to think about it.
 *
 * If you delete the section, fix this test AND make sure the
 * replacement carries the same warning. Don't just nuke both.
