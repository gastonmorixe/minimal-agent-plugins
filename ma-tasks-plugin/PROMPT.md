# Tasks

Use `Task` to plan and track multi-step work the user can watch in real time. The live list is auto-injected into every user turn as a `<ma::agent::tasks ...>` block, so you always see the current plan without re-querying.

## When to use

- **Use it** when you're about to do something with **3+ distinct steps** the user will want to track. Most refactors, multi-file changes, bug investigations with branching hypotheses, anything where "the plan" is a meaningful artifact.
- **Use it** when the user says "make a plan", "what would you do", "let's tackle X", or otherwise signals they want to see the shape of the work before you start.
- **A single task with 3+ substeps** worth tracking: use `parent` to nest. Tree depth is limited to 2 (top-level + one layer of children). Don't try to nest deeper.

## When not to use

- Trivial 1-2 step tasks. Just do them.
- Recording past decisions or lessons-learned. That's `memory`.
- Tracking transient agent-internal state ("remember to re-grep after this edit"). Use `short-term` memory.
- Free-form notes for the user. Put those in your prose response.

## Workflow

1. **Plan in one shot.** `Task({action: "add_many", titles: [...]})` at the start, or `items: [{title, children?}]` when you need subtasks in the same call (`titles` XOR `items`; children are `string[]` only). Don't drip-feed tasks one at a time. The user wants to see the whole plan up front.
2. **Start before you work.** `Task({action: "start", id: N})` flips the task to `doing` AND demotes any other `doing` task back to `todo` (single-focus discipline). The user's progress meter stays unambiguous. Use `parallel: true` only if you genuinely have two tasks in flight at once (rare).
3. **Done when materially complete.** `Task({action: "done", id: N})`. Don't pre-mark. Only mark `done` when you've actually finished the work the title described.
4. **New substeps surface as you work.** If you discover a task is actually 3 substeps, `Task({action: "add", title: "...", parent: "#<hash>"})` for each. Then `start` the first child.
5. **Plans change.** If the user redirects, don't silently abandon tasks:
   - If a task was never started, `remove` it.
   - If a task is still in-flight or was completed but reverted,
     `status: "canceled"` with a one-line `reason`.

## Id resolution

Every action that takes an `id` accepts THREE shapes:

- **Position** (1-indexed integer). `id: 3` means the third top-level task in the list. Most natural in conversational use.
- **Bare hash**: `id: "a7b3c4"`. Six lowercase hex chars.
- **Prefixed hash**: `id: "#a7b3c4"`. Same as bare. The `#` is purely cosmetic.
- **Subtask hash**: `id: "a7b3c4a"`. Parent's hash + a-z suffix.

The hash is stable across reorders and deletes. The position shifts. So when reordering or doing bulk operations, lean on the hash. For single "mark the next one done" interactions, the position is fine.

## Status state machine

```
             add
              │
              ▼
   ┌────┐   start    ┌─────┐  complete   ┌────┐
   │todo│ ─────────► │doing│ ──────────► │done│
   └──┬─┘            └──┬──┘             └────┘
      └──── cancel ◄────┘
```

- `start` (or `status: "doing"`) on a `todo` or `done` task.
- `done` (or `status: "done"`) on a `doing` task.
- `status: "canceled"` from any state, with optional `reason`.
- `status: "todo"` to reset (rare, usually `start` again instead).

## `canceled` is "abandoned", not "done"

`canceled` means the work was given up on. `done` means the work finished. The two are not interchangeable, and the renderer paints them in opposite colors (lime ✔ for done, red ✘ with strikethrough for canceled), so picking the wrong verb reads as the opposite of intent.

Common confusions:

- **Phase / section headers.** If you add a top-level task like `"PHASE 1: Setup"` and the work under it finishes, the header is `done`, not `canceled`. The phase IS done. Reasoning like "the header itself had no direct work, so it was never going to be done" is wrong. A header means the work under it, and that work happened.
- **Parents with all-done children.** Same idea. A parent task whose subtasks are all `done` should itself be `done`. The store does not auto-promote, that is on you.
- **Tasks made moot by a sibling.** If task B made task A's goal unnecessary because the goal already got achieved (just elsewhere), A is `done`. If A's goal was actively rejected, A is `canceled` with a one-line `reason`.

For multi-phase plans, real parent/subtask structure is cleaner than flat pseudo-headers. Phase becomes the parent, and the work under it becomes subtasks:

```
const phase1 = Task({action: "add", title: "Phase 1: Setup"})
Task({action: "add", title: "step a", parent: `#${phase1.hash}`})
Task({action: "add", title: "step b", parent: `#${phase1.hash}`})
   ...
Task({action: "done", id: `#${phase1.hash}`})
```

A flat list with "PHASE 1" pseudo-headers at the top level also works, but each header is then a real task and needs a real `done` (or `canceled` with a reason) when the phase ends.

## Examples

Start a new plan:

```
Task({
  action: "add_many",
  titles: [
    "Add contextSize to SessionTokens",
    "Update addSessionUsage callers",
    "Update clearSessionTokens to reset contextSize",
    "Update src/session-tokens.test.ts",
    "Run biome format + lint on touched files"
  ]
})
```

Work through it:

```
Task({action: "start", id: 1})
   ...do the work, then...
Task({action: "done", id: 1})
Task({action: "start", id: 2})
   ...
```

Discover substeps mid-task:

```
Task({action: "add", title: "Zero-state includes contextSize", parent: "#d04c91"})
Task({action: "add", title: "Multi-turn growth pinned", parent: "#d04c91"})
Task({action: "start", id: "#d04c91a"})   # subtask hash = parent + 'a'
```

Cancel a step the user redirected away from:

```
Task({action: "status", id: 6, status: "canceled", reason: "user wants to keep the legacy column"})
```

## Don't

- Don't echo the rendered task list back to the user as prose. They see the rich rendering in the transcript already. Restating in markdown is noise.
- Don't `remove` a task as a way of "cleaning up". That erases the audit trail. Use `status: "canceled"` for anything that materially existed but was later abandoned. Only `remove` tasks you accidentally added or that the user explicitly asks to drop.
- Don't reach for `canceled` when you mean `done`. If a phase header, parent task, or planning placeholder has no direct work of its own but the work under it finished, mark it `done`. See "`canceled` is 'abandoned', not 'done'" above.
- Don't fight the single-doing discipline with `parallel: true` unless you genuinely have parallel work. The discipline is the point. The user reads the meter as "where is the agent right now".
- Don't try to nest beyond depth 2 (subtask of a subtask). `Task` refuses it. Flatten the deepest layer into the parent's title or split into a sibling top-level task.
