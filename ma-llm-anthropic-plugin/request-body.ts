/**
 * Re-export shim — the Anthropic Messages request-body builder + its wire
 * types moved to the leaf contract package `@minimal-agent/plugin-api`.
 *
 * The implementation now lives at `plugin-api/src/llm/anthropic-request.ts` so
 * an Anthropic-compatible gateway (e.g. opencode) can vendor the SAME builder
 * from the leaf instead of cross-importing this plugin. This shim keeps the
 * old in-plugin path working for the anthropic adapter + tests until the
 * plugin itself is migrated.
 *
 * @module llm/providers/anthropic/request-body
