/**
 * Net-seam characterization: the OpenAI adapter takes its `NetworkClient`
 * from the run context (`ctx.networkClient`), NOT from a module-level import
 * of the host's `defaultNetworkClient` singleton.
 *
 * Wave D (net seam): the host owns the network singleton and threads it into
 * `RunContext.networkClient` (see `src/llm/run.ts`). A provider plugin must be
 * able to live in its own repo, so it cannot import the host's
 * `defaultNetworkClient` from `src/network` as a fallback. The client crosses
 * the provider port, typed by the leaf contract net-types module.
 *
 * Two cases:
 *   1. (positive) an injected fake client is the one actually called, and the
 *      adapter streams its response through the translators — proof the seam
 *      works end to end with a leaf-typed client.
 *   2. (guard / red-first) with NO `ctx.networkClient` the adapter throws a
 *      clear error instead of silently reaching for a global. This FAILS while
 *      the adapter still falls back to `defaultNetworkClient`; it passes once
 *      the fallback is removed and the seam is the sole path.
