/**
 * tsc provider (TypeScript type diagnostics) via spawn-based `tsc --noEmit`.
 *
 * This is the FALLBACK type provider for projects that have the standard
 * `typescript` package (tsc / tsserver) but NOT the `tsgo` Go-native preview
 * compiler. Detection prefers `tsgo` when both are present.
 *
 * Unlike the persistent LSP providers, this spawns `tsc --noEmit` per check
 * and parses its stdout. It checks the ENTIRE project, then filters findings
 * to the target file. Warm-up is ~300-500ms vs tsgo's ~2-3ms; it's perfectly
 * adequate for small-to-medium projects and is always available.
 *
 * Resilience: a non-zero exit from tsc is EXPECTED (it means errors were
 * found). Only a spawn failure (ENOENT, signal) degrades.
 *
