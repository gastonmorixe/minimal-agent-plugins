/**
 * Network-client contract — the provider-neutral TYPE surface a plugin needs
 * to make HTTP calls through the host's shared transport, without importing
 * `src/network/index.ts`.
 *
 * Wave D (net seam): every provider adapter used to
 * `import { defaultNetworkClient, type NetworkClient } from "../../src/network/index.ts"`
 * for two things — the runtime singleton (an instrumented fetch facade) AND
 * the `NetworkClient` type to annotate it. The singleton is HOST STATE (it
 * carries process-wide observers, transport selection, and HTTP/3 policy), so
 * it STAYS in `src/network/` and the host threads it to adapters through the
 * context they already receive (`RunContext.networkClient`). The TYPE, by
 * contrast, is provider-neutral and pure, so it lives here in the leaf contract
 * package where both the host and the plugins can depend on it.
 *
 * These are faithful, type-only structural copies of the host's shapes in
 * `src/network/types.ts` + `src/network/client.ts` (the D-1 "leaf-safe
 * structural copy" pattern, same as `PluginLogger` / `PluginHost`). The host
 * keeps the runtime `NetworkClient` / `NetworkResponse` CLASSES as the single
 * source of truth; TypeScript's structural typing makes those real objects
 * satisfy the interfaces here, so the host hands its real
 * `defaultNetworkClient` into a package-typed `ctx.networkClient` without a
 * cast, and a plugin reads it back as a package-typed `NetworkClient`.
