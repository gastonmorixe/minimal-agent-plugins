/**
 * Shared modality gating.
 *
 * Turns unsupported image / audio / file inputs into structured
 * `CapabilityViolation`s instead of letting the request-body builders
 * silently drop them. This is the canonical layer's "no silent feature
 * dropping" principle applied to multimodal input: every provider's
 * `validate()` calls this so the behavior is identical across providers.
 *
 * Wave D-2: moved WHOLE into the leaf contract package. Its entire dependency
 * graph (`CanonicalMessage`, `Capabilities`, `CapabilityViolation`) now
 * resolves in-package, so plugins can validate modality without reaching into
 * `src/`. The `src/llm/modality-check.ts` shim re-exports this module.
 *
