/**
 * Pure renderer for the quota-status footer line.
 *
 * Visual (term width permitting):
 *
 *   5h █▌░░░░░░ 21% 4h32m    7d ░░░░░░░░ 8% 6d11h    1M ▎░░░░░░░ 24% 232.4k    effort medium    b1d82846
 *
 * Design rules (A2 layout — May 2026):
 *   - No leading "quota" word — the bar is the visual cue.
 *   - 8-cell bar with fractional fill (1/8th eighth-block ramp) for sub-cell
 *     precision.
 *   - Bar fill colour-graded by severity (green under 60%, yellow 60-84%, red ≥85%).
 *   - **Window name is a LEFT label**, not a trailing word. Promotes the name
 *     from grammatically-a-duration (next to the reset countdown, which is
 *     itself a duration) to grammatically-a-title (anchoring the segment).
 *     Pre-A2 the trailing pair `<pct> <name> <reset>` (e.g. "88% 5h 14m")
 *     was ambiguous to the eye — `5h` and `14m` are visually identical.
 *   - Reset countdown follows the bar+pct as a dim trailing duration.
 *     No `·` separator — dim color + single-space gap is enough
 *     disambiguation, and it saves two cells per segment. No `↻` icon
 *     either (heavier than the values it joins).
 *   - Session block on the right: shares the same skeleton as a quota
 *     segment — `<label> <bar> <pct> <meta>`. The label is the model's
 *     context-window size formatted compactly (`200k`, `1M`, `500k`,
 *     etc.) — informative, parallel-in-role to the quota labels
 *     (`5h`/`7d`) that anchor each segment with what their bar
 *     represents. When the context window is **unknown** (no
 *     `MINIMAL_AGENT_MODEL` in env), the label falls back to a dim
 *     middle-dot `·` placeholder and the bar+percent drop (we can't
 *     compute fill without a denominator); the trailing count remains.
 *     The bar (when shown) renders `contextSize / contextWindow`. The
 *     trailing meta is the live count: bold when `contextSize > 0` ("this
 *     is your current usage"), dim when 0 (pre-traffic shape stays
 *     quiet, parallel to `5h`/`7d`). The cumulative-sum approach
 *     (pre-May 2026) over-counted cached prefixes by ~N× since the same
 *     prefix is re-read every turn; `contextSize` is the latest-turn
 *     value, not a sum.
 *   - Session block ALWAYS renders when `showSession` is on, even at 0 tokens.
 *     Pre-traffic users see `1M ░░░░░░░░ 0% 0` (or `· 0` if window is
 *     unknown) — a "this is your context budget" signpost from the
 *     very first paint.
 *   - 4-space group separator between distinct segments.
 *   - "overage" hidden by default (set MINIMAL_AGENT_QUOTA_OVERAGE=1 to surface).
 *   - Trailing `effort <level>` segment (faintWhite label, bold value): the
 *     reasoning effort being sent on the wire. No bar — effort is categorical
 *     (low/medium/high/max), not continuous. No colour-grading either; the
 *     green/yellow/red palette belongs to severity and would read
 *     "high effort == bad". Suppressed entirely when the caller passes no
 *     effort (haiku models don't accept the wire field).
 *   - Absolute-trailing bare-hex session-id anchor (dim, no label). Renders
 *     verbatim — the caller pre-shortens to whatever prefix length disambiguates
 *     inside `~/.minimal-agent/sessions/` (the quota-status handler takes 8
 *     hex chars). Bare (no `sid` label) because the 8-hex pattern is visually
 *     distinct enough at line-end and dropping the label saves 4 cells. Dim
 *     because it's static reference, not a live reading. Lives at the
 *     absolute end so terminal double/triple-click selects it cleanly.
 *   - Responsive degradation: drop tail segments when the result would overflow `cols`.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no env reads, no `Date.now()` except via the injectable `now()`.

 *   4. Bars shrink {@link BAR_CELLS_MAX} → {@link BAR_CELLS_MIN} cells.
 *   5. Tail segments drop in order: effort → session bar → reset
 *      clauses → session entirely → 7d window. The 5h window is the
 *      irreducible last-stand.
 *   6. If even the leanest candidate would overflow `cols` (should
 *      never happen — but a safety net beats overflow), the renderer
 *      clips with a dim `…` ellipsis (Rule 3 floor). Opt-out via
 *      `overflow: "wrap"` for users who prefer multi-line overflow.
 *
 * The session block is kept around even at 0 contextSize so users see their
 * context-window budget bar from the start. It drops only when terminal
 * width physically can't accommodate it.
